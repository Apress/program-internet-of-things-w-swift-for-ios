The Authorization Code Grant flow has the following steps:

Your application redirects the user to Fitbit's authorization page. See Authorization Page below.

Upon user consent, Fitbit redirects the user back to your application's callback URL with an authorization code as a URL parameter.
Your application exchanges the authorization code for an access token and refresh token. See Access Token Request below.
Your application stores the access token and refresh token. It will use the access token to make requests to the Fitbit API. It will use the refresh token to obtain a new access token when the access token expires without having to re-prompt the user. (More information on the refresh token is below in the "Refreshing Tokens" section.)





For the OAuth 2.0 API we will use the AeroGear framework. The AeroGear GitHub page can be found here:

https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-oauth2




You can install the SDK manually into your project, which is bit more work; the easiest way is to install a dependency manager that will allow us to install the SDK on our Mac, such as Cocoapods or Carthage.
The easiest way is to use cocoapods:

sudo gem install cocoapods
pod init FitBit.xcodeproj

The first command is run with root privileges to install Cocoapods, then as the regular user, the second command will create a file called Podfile. Use a text editor or vim to edit the Podfile file and add AeroGear support:

target 'FitBit' do
    pod 'AeroGearOAuth2'
end


Now you can install the AeroGear Libraries in your project (Listing 5-1):

Listing 5-1. Installing the AeroGear Libraries in your project

$ pod install
Updating local specs repositories
Analyzing dependencies
Downloading dependencies
Installing AeroGearHttp (0.4.1)
Installing AeroGearOAuth2 (0.4.0)
Generating Pods project
Integrating client project

[!] Please close any current Xcode sessions and use `FitBit.xcworkspace` for this project from now on.
Sending stats
Pod installation complete! There is 1 dependency from the Podfile and 2 total pods installed.


Follow the suggestion of the installer: close your XCode project, and open instead the FitBit.xcworkspace project.
